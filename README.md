# PathX-CNN: An Enhanced Explainable Convolutional Neural Network for Survival Prediction and Pathway Analysis in Glioblastoma

Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor with poor prognosis, necessitating advanced computational methods for personalized treatment strategies. We present PathX-CNN, an enhanced explainable convolutional neural network designed for survival prediction and pathway analysis in GBM. Our model integrates multiomics data, leveraging deep learning and explainability techniques to identify key molecular pathways and their associated significant genes. PathX-CNN provides biologically meaningful insights into GBM progression. Extensive evaluations demonstrate its superior predictive performance and biological relevance compared to existing models, making it a powerful tool for precision oncology.

We compared our framework with DeepKEGG, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayesian Classifier, and PathCNN. In addition to GBM data, our framework was also validated by KIRC, LGG, LUAD, and LUSC data.
